We adjust tensorflow/configure.py

When you see this:
./tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/mpi/BUILD:60:1: undeclared inc_mgr':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/contrib/mpi/mpi_rendezvous_mgr.cc
  'third_party/mpi/cray_version.h'
  'third_party/mpi/mpio.h'
  'third_party/mpi/mpicxx.h'
In file included from ./tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h:24:0,
                 from ./tensorflow/core/platform/logging.h:25,
                 from ./tensorflow/contrib/mpi/mpi_utils.h:25,
                 from ./tensorflow/contrib/mpi/mpi_rendezvous_mgr.h:34,
                 from tensorflow/contrib/mpi/mpi_rendezvous_mgr.cc:18:


Open the file: tensorflow/bazel-tensorflow/third_party/mpi_collectives/BUILD
And add the 3 missing *.h to cc_library hdrs:
cc_library(
    name = "mpi",
    srcs = select({
        "//tensorflow:darwin": ["libmpi.dylib"],
        "//conditions:default": ["libmpi.so"],
    }),
    hdrs = [
        "mpi.h",
        "cray_version.h",
        "mpiio.h",
        "mpicxx.h",
        "mpi_portable_platform",
    ],
)
